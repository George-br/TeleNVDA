This release improves compatibility with Python 3.11. A MiniUPNP Python module built for 3.11 has been included, and some deprecation warnings have been fixed. As a consequence, all stored server fingerprints become invalid, so warnings will be displayed when connecting to insecure known servers. Also, translations have been updated.
