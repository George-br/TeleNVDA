This development release includes the following changes:

* Added an experimental feature to forward ports for direct connections using UPNP. A router device with UPNP enabled is required to test this functionality.
* One translatable string was not displayed properly.
* In the connection and options dialogs, port fields are numeric. You can only type numbers, and press up or down arrow keys to increase or decrease the value.
* A custom portcheck service is used instead of the provided by NVDA Remote. It's hosted on the nvda.es website.
